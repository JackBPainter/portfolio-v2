Hey I'm Jack, an enthusiastic and passionate junior full-stack
developer. After more than 4 years of working on the sales side of IT,
I decided enough was enough and made the decision to drop it all and
become a developer.

and I am now planning to create a Tetris
application using hook based functional components.

When I'm not coding you'll find me playing about with my DSLR (any
tips would be very welcome), gaming, listening to vinyls, attending
meetups and following the Formula 1 & football.
