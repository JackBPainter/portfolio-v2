Hey I'm Jack Painter, an enthusiastic and passionate Junior Front-End/React
Developer. I have been developing front-end applications for just under 
a year now and my personal favourite was a Tetris game built using React. 

When I'm not coding you'll find me playing about with my DSLR (any
tips would be very welcome), gaming, listening to vinyls, attending
meetups and following the Formula 1 & football.
